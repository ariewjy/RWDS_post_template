# RWDS Template 👨🏼‍💻

> Render the `report.qmd` file with quarto to generate the report.

- content-brief.qmd
This file, `content-brief.qmd`, serves as an example demonstrating the expected content for a Read, Write, Develop, and Share (RWDS) article. It provides a template or guide for structuring the content of an article within the RWDS framework.

- report.qmd
`report.qmd` is a Quarto file, intended to be the main document where you compose your article. The default version of this file includes a showcase of Quarto formatting options. Quarto is a versatile document format that facilitates the creation of beautifully formatted articles.

- references.bib
The `references.bib` file is in BibTeX format, which is a standard format for bibliographic information. This file serves as a centralized repository for storing references—such as academic papers, books, or other works—relevant to your article. By maintaining your references in this structured format, you can easily cite them within the `report.qmd` file, and they will be automatically formatted in the specified citation style when generating the article. This ensures accurate and consistent citations in your articles.

- images folder
In this folder you should store all your images and figures. In your `report.qmd` you can insert them as `![figure caption](./images/figure.png)`.
